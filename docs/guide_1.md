# Introduction

This workshop relies on the AWS Infrastructure and the objective is to have a overview of the features that ACM offers.

It’s important to note that this workshop covers only a subset of the available configuration options. The intent is not to provide a complete or exhaustive view of all possible setups, but rather to serve as a starting point or example for understanding how ACM and OpenShift can be deployed together on AWS. Further customizations may be required to be implemented based on your organization’s unique requirements.

This hands on Workshop is running on AWS cloud hyperscaller and provides an overview of the Red Hat ACM (Advanced Cluster Management). It will demonstrate key features that will help understand how ACM can be used to manage the:
- Lifecycle of the OpenShift spoke clusters, such as creation of clusters. 
- Application Lifecycle, to deploy applications using GitOps
- Governance Risc and Compliance, to apply policies that control the allowed configurations.
- Observability, from ACM having visibility of the metrics of the overal spoke clusters using Grafana.
